# Playtime Tracker for Foundry VTT

This module keeps track of how much real time players and GM has spent in the world.

- Tracks time automatically from login to logout, saving it even if the server hiccups.
- Everyone can see the full list: sorted by who's played the most, with avatars, online dots, and GM tags.
- Pop it up with /playtime.
- Times show up nice and simple, like "2d 5h 30m".

## How to Use it:

- Just type /playtime in chat and hit enter. Up comes the dialog with everyone listed, their pics, status (green dot for online, pink for offline), and playtimes.
- User Side: Avatar, name, GM badge if they're gamemaster or assistant, and a status indicator.
- Playtime Side: Easy readout in days/hours/minutes.
